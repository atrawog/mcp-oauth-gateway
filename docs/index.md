## Sacred Commandments

This project follows the **Ten Sacred Commandments of Divine Python Development** as decreed in CLAUDE.md:

1. **No Mocks or Burn in Production Hell** - Real testing only!
2. **The Holy Trinity of Tools** - just, pixi, docker-compose
3. **Sacred Project Structure** - Divine isolation is mandatory
4. **Configuration Through .env** - All config flows through .env
5. **Docker Compose for All Services** - Compose is the divine orchestrator
6. **Pytest and Coverage** - Pytest is the only true test runner
7. **Real Health Checks** - Only healthchecks save from random failures
8. **Centralized Logging** - Scattered logs = lost wisdom
9. **Document with Jupyter Book** - Divine documentation tooling
