## Command Categories

### üèóÔ∏è Project Setup Commands

#### `just setup`
**Purpose**: Initialize the MCP OAuth Gateway project with all dependencies and infrastructure.

```bash
just setup
```

**What it does**:
- Creates required Docker networks (`public`)
- Creates required Docker volumes (certificates, redis-data, etc.)
- Installs Python dependencies via pixi
- Prepares the environment for first run

**When to use**: First time setting up the project or after a clean checkout.

#### `just network-create`
**Purpose**: Create the sacred shared Docker network for service communication.

```bash
just network-create
```

**Details**:
- Creates the `public` Docker network if it doesn't exist
- Used by all services for inter-service communication
- Traefik uses this network for routing

#### `just volumes-create`
**Purpose**: Create all required Docker volumes for persistent data.

```bash
just volumes-create
```

**Creates volumes**:

- Ensures networks and volumes exist
- Starts all services via docker-compose
- Waits for services to become healthy
- Shows service readiness status

#### `just up-fresh`
**Purpose**: Start all services with fresh builds and recreation.

```bash
just up-fresh
```

**What it does**:
- Builds all services from scratch
- Forces recreation of containers (`--force-recreate`)
- Starts all services
- Waits for health checks to pass

**When to use**: After significant code changes or when containers need rebuilding.

#### `just down`
**Purpose**: Stop all services gracefully.

```bash
just down
```

**What it does**:
- Stops all running containers
- Removes containers but preserves volumes
- Preserves networks for next startup

#### `just build-all`
**Purpose**: Build all service images without starting them.

```bash
just build-all
```

**What it does**:
- Ensures infrastructure exists (networks, volumes)
- Builds all Docker images
- Does not start containers

#### `just rebuild-all`
**Purpose**: Completely rebuild all services from scratch.

```bash
just rebuild-all
```

**What it does**:
- Stops all services
- Rebuilds all images with `--no-cache`

- Waits for health checks

**When to use**: When you need to ensure completely fresh builds.

#### `just rebuild <service>`
**Purpose**: Rebuild a specific service only.

```bash
just rebuild auth
just rebuild mcp-fetch
just rebuild traefik
```

**What it does**:
- Rebuilds the specified service with `--no-cache`
- Restarts only that service
- Other services continue running

**Examples**:
```bash
just rebuild auth          # Rebuild auth service
just rebuild mcp-fetch     # Rebuild MCP fetch service
just rebuild traefik       # Rebuild Traefik proxy
```

- `GATEWAY_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`: OAuth access token
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`: GitHub OAuth application credentials

## Error Handling

All commands include error handling and informative output:

- ‚úÖ Success indicators for completed operations
- ‚ùå Error messages with troubleshooting hints
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings for potentially dangerous operations
- üîç Diagnostic information for debugging

## Integration with Sacred Commandments

These commands follow the **Ten Sacred Commandments**:

1. **No Mocks**: All tests use real services
2. **Holy Trinity**: Uses `just`, `pixi`, and `docker-compose`
3. **Real Systems**: Tests against actual Docker containers
4. **Configuration via .env**: All config through environment
5. **Centralized Logging**: Logs flow to `./logs/`

Run `just --list` to see all available commands with brief descriptions.
