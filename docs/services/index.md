# MCP Services

The MCP OAuth Gateway hosts multiple Model Context Protocol services, each providing specialized functionality while sharing a common authentication and routing infrastructure.

## Service Architecture

All MCP services follow the same architectural pattern:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    subgraph "Service Container"
        A[Official MCP Server] --> B[mcp-streamablehttp-proxy]
        B --> C[HTTP Endpoint]
    end
    
    subgraph "Infrastructure"
        D[Traefik Router] --> E[OAuth Middleware]
        E --> C
        F[Health Checks] --> C
    end
    
    subgraph "Clients"
        G[Claude.ai] --> D
        H[MCP Clients] --> D
        I[Testing Tools] --> D
    end

| MCP Memory | `https://mcp-memory.${BASE_DOMAIN}/mcp` | MCP 2025-06-18 |
| MCP Time | `https://mcp-time.${BASE_DOMAIN}/mcp` | MCP 2025-06-18 |
| MCP Sequential Thinking | `https://mcp-sequentialthinking.${BASE_DOMAIN}/mcp` | MCP 2025-06-18 |
| MCP Filesystem | `https://mcp-filesystem.${BASE_DOMAIN}/mcp` | MCP 2025-06-18 |
| MCP Everything | `https://mcp-everything.${BASE_DOMAIN}/mcp` | MCP 2025-06-18 |

| MCP Playwright | `https://mcp-playwright.${BASE_DOMAIN}/mcp` | MCP 2025-06-18 |

## Common Endpoints

All services provide standard endpoints:

### Primary Endpoints
- **`/mcp`** - Main MCP protocol endpoint (requires authentication)
- **`/health`** - Health check endpoint (public)
- **`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`** - OAuth discovery (public)

### Health Check Response
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-21T23:38:12Z",
  "service": "mcp-fetch",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Authentication Flow

All services use the same OAuth 2.1 authentication flow:

1. **Client Registration** - Register via `/register` endpoint
2. **Authorization** - Obtain authorization code via `/authorize`
3. **Token Exchange** - Exchange code for access token via `/token`
4. **Service Access** - Use Bearer token to access MCP endpoints

## Development Patterns

### Adding a New Service

To add a new MCP service:

1. **Create Service Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir mcp-newservice
   cd mcp-newservice
   ```

2. **Create Dockerfile**
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.12-alpine
   # Install official MCP server
   RUN pip install mcp-server-newservice
   # Install proxy
   COPY ../mcp-streamablehttp-proxy /tmp/proxy
   RUN pip install /tmp/proxy
   # Wrap the server
   CMD mcp-streamablehttp-proxy python -m mcp_server_newservice
   ```

3. **Create docker-compose.yml**
   ```yaml
   services:
     mcp-newservice:
       build: .
       labels:
         - "traefik.http.routers.mcp-newservice.rule=Host(`mcp-newservice.${BASE_DOMAIN}`)"
         # ... routing configuration
   ```

4. **Add to Main Compose**
   ```yaml
   include:
     - mcp-newservice/docker-compose.yml
   ```

5. **Create Tests**
   ```python
   # tests/test_mcp_newservice_integration.py
   # tests/test_mcp_newservice_comprehensive.py
   ```

### Service Configuration

Standard environment variables for all services:

```bash
# Protocol configuration
MCP_PROTOCOL_VERSION=2025-06-18
MCP_CORS_ORIGINS=*
PORT=3000

# Domain configuration (from .env)
BASE_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Monitoring
- **Docker Health Checks** - Container-level monitoring
- **HTTP Health Endpoints** - Application-level monitoring
- **Traefik Dashboard** - Traffic and routing monitoring

### Logging
- **Centralized Logs** - All services log to `./logs/`
- **Structured Logging** - JSON format for parsing
- **Log Rotation** - Automatic cleanup and archival

### Metrics
- **Request Metrics** - Traefik provides request/response metrics
- **Service Metrics** - Custom metrics via health endpoints
- **Performance Monitoring** - Response time and throughput tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service Not Starting**
   ```bash
   # Check container logs
   docker logs mcp-servicename
   
   # Check health status
   curl https://mcp-servicename.yourdomain.com/health
   ```

2. **Authentication Failures**
   ```bash
   # Verify OAuth configuration
   curl https://mcp-servicename.yourdomain.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
   
   # Test token validity
   mcp-streamablehttp-client --test-auth
   ```

3. **Protocol Issues**
   ```bash
   # Test protocol compliance
   mcp-streamablehttp-client --list-tools
   
   # Check protocol version
   just test-file tests/test_mcp_servicename_integration.py
   ```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Service status
just logs mcp-servicename

# Full system health
just check-health

# Test specific service
just test-file tests/test_mcp_servicename_comprehensive.py

# Protocol compliance check
just test-protocol-compliance
```

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage
- **Memory** - Each service container: ~50-100MB
- **CPU** - Minimal unless processing large requests
- **Storage** - Logs and temporary files only (except mcp-memory)

### Scaling
- **Horizontal** - Multiple instances behind Traefik
- **Vertical** - Resource limits via Docker
- **Load Balancing** - Traefik automatic load balancing

### Optimization
- **Caching** - HTTP caching headers where appropriate
- **Connection Pooling** - Persistent connections for efficiency
- **Resource Limits** - Docker memory and CPU constraints
