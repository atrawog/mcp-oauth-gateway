# Test Registration Cleanup Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to ensure OAuth client registrations created during tests are always properly cleaned up.

## Problem

- Tests were creating OAuth client registrations but not always cleaning them up
- Over 840 test client registrations had accumulated in the system
- This could lead to performance issues and confusion

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Immediate Cleanup

- Added `oauth-delete-test-registrations` command to the justfile
- Updated `manage_oauth_data.py` script with a new `delete-test-registrations` function
- Successfully cleaned up 840 test client registrations

### 2. Improved Test Infrastructure

Added to `tests/conftest.py`:

1. **Helper Function**: `cleanup_client_registration()` - Centralized cleanup logic using RFC 7592 DELETE endpoint

2. **Context Manager**: `RegisteredClientContext` - Ensures cleanup even if tests fail:
   ```python
   async with RegisteredClientContext(http_client) as ctx:
       client_data = await ctx.register_client({...})
       # Cleanup happens automatically
   ```

3. **Global Registry**: Tracks all test registrations for session-level cleanup

4. **Session Cleanup**: `_cleanup_test_registrations_at_end` fixture ensures any remaining registrations are cleaned up after all tests complete

### 3. Updated Test Patterns

Tests now have three options for proper cleanup:

1. **Use `registered_client` fixture** (recommended for simple cases):
   ```python
   async def test_something(registered_client):
       # Use registered_client - cleanup is automatic
   ```

2. **Use `RegisteredClientContext`** (for complex cases):
   ```python
   async with RegisteredClientContext(http_client) as ctx:
       client1 = await ctx.register_client({...})
       client2 = await ctx.register_client({...})
       # All clients cleaned up automatically
   ```

3. **Manual cleanup** using the helper function:
   ```python
   client_data = await http_client.post("/register", ...)
   try:
       # Test logic
   finally:
       await cleanup_client_registration(http_client, client_data)
   ```

### 4. Audit Script

Created `scripts/audit_test_registrations.py` to:
- Find all test files that create registrations
- Check if they have proper cleanup
- Generate a report of files needing updates

## Results

- ✅ Cleaned up 840 test client registrations
- ✅ All test files now properly handle cleanup
- ✅ Session-level safety net ensures no registrations are left behind
- ✅ Easy-to-use patterns for future test development

## Maintenance

To ensure continued cleanliness:

1. Run `just oauth-stats` periodically to check for accumulating test registrations
2. Use `just oauth-delete-test-registrations` if manual cleanup is needed
3. Run `pixi run python scripts/audit_test_registrations.py` to audit test files
4. Always use one of the three cleanup patterns when writing new tests

## Commands Reference

```bash
# View current registrations
just oauth-list-registrations

# View OAuth statistics
just oauth-stats

# Delete all test registrations
just oauth-delete-test-registrations

# Delete a specific registration
just oauth-delete-registration <client_id>

# Audit test files for proper cleanup
pixi run python scripts/audit_test_registrations.py
```
