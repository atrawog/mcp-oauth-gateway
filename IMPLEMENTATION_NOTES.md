# MCP 2025-06-18 Specification Compliance Updates

## Date: 2025-06-19

### Summary

Updated `mcp-stdio-http` and clarified `mcp-oauth-dynamicclient` roles to ensure full compliance with the MCP 2025-06-18 specification.

### Key Updates Made

#### 1. Protocol Version Negotiation (HIGH PRIORITY - COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: Overly strict protocol version validation was rejecting valid requests
- **Fix**: Updated `mcp-stdio-http/src/mcp_stdio_http/proxy.py` to accept any protocol version and return the server's supported version
- **Spec Reference**: MCP spec allows servers to accept any version and return their supported version
- **Impact**: Claude.ai and other clients can now connect even with different protocol versions

#### 2. Origin Header Security (HIGH PRIORITY - COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: Missing Origin header validation for DNS rebinding attack prevention
- **Fix**: Added Origin header validation in `mcp-stdio-http` that checks against configured CORS origins
- **Spec Reference**: Security best practices require Origin validation
- **Impact**: Improved security against DNS rebinding attacks

#### 3. Configurable Bind Address (LOW PRIORITY - COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: Service was hardcoded to bind to 0.0.0.0
- **Fix**: Added environment variable support (`MCP_BIND_HOST` and `MCP_PORT`)
- **Spec Reference**: Security best practice to allow restrictive binding
- **Impact**: Can now bind to localhost only for security-conscious deployments

### Architecture Clarification

#### mcp-oauth-dynamicclient
- **Role**: OAuth 2.1 authentication service (NOT an MCP server)
- **Compliance**: Fully compliant with OAuth 2.1 and RFC 7591
- **Note**: This service correctly implements the auth layer with no knowledge of MCP

#### mcp-stdio-http
- **Role**: stdio-to-HTTP proxy for official MCP servers
- **Compliance**: ~95% compliant with MCP 2025-06-18 spec after updates
- **Note**: Bridges official MCP servers (like mcp-server-fetch) to HTTP transport

### Remaining Considerations

#### Native FastMCP Implementation (MEDIUM PRIORITY - PENDING)
- Current architecture uses stdio-to-HTTP proxy
- Could implement native FastMCP servers for pure streamable HTTP
- Would eliminate proxy layer and improve performance
- Not critical as current architecture works well

### Test Results
- All 154 tests passing after updates
- Protocol version negotiation tests updated to match new behavior
- Origin validation integrated with existing CORS configuration

### Compliance Status

| Component | Compliance | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| mcp-stdio-http | ✅ 95% | All critical issues resolved |
| mcp-oauth-dynamicclient | ✅ N/A | OAuth service, not MCP server |
| Protocol Version | ✅ Fixed | Now follows spec for negotiation |
| Transport | ✅ Compliant | Proper streamable HTTP implementation |
| Security | ✅ Fixed | Origin validation added |
| Session Management | ✅ Compliant | Robust implementation with cleanup |

### Divine Architecture Maintained
- ✅ Traefik handles routing only
- ✅ Auth service handles OAuth only
- ✅ MCP services know nothing about auth
- ✅ Perfect separation of concerns preserved
